== Source Code ==

The source code is in my git repository on Github:

→ http://github.com/sorcix/sIRC

Note that the master git repository is just my working copy,
so it might not always contain usable code. Please check the downloads
page on github to download code that i've tagged as working:

→ http://github.com/sorcix/sIRC/downloads

Old versions (1.1.0 and older) can be found on Google Code:

== Support ==

As sIRC contains about everything I needed, I'm not spending much
time on it anymore. However, if you encounter a bug, or have a feature
request, don't hesitate to let me know.

Use the sIRC issues page

Or send me an e-mail

Thanks for your interest in sIRC!
If you're using it somewhere, let me know. :)
